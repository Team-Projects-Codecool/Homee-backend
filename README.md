# What is Homee
Homee is a physical device manger: dumb or smart - all devices belong here. Your home, your office, your workshop, your personal. Keep track of the warranty periods and scan the documentation to access easily their serial numbers for repair or resell, access their access keys, or... their usual storage place.
